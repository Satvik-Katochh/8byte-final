# Elevator System Simulation & Optimization Assignment

## 🎯 **PROJECT OVERVIEW**

A web-based elevator simulation system with intelligent scheduling algorithm that efficiently handles passenger requests while prioritizing user experience.

## 📚 **LEARNING APPROACH - CRITICAL**

### **Step-by-Step Methodology:**

- **ONE file at a time** - Never generate multiple files simultaneously
- **ONE concept at a time** - Explain each TypeScript concept thoroughly before moving on
- **LINE-BY-LINE explanation** - Explain what each line of code does
- **SLOW pace** - User is learning TypeScript, so take it very slow
- **ASK for understanding** - Check if user understands before proceeding
- **NO overwhelming code** - Keep files small and simple

### **Code Generation Rules:**

- **Maximum 20-30 lines per file** initially
- **Explain every TypeScript concept** as it's introduced
- **Break complex concepts** into simple parts
- **Use comments extensively** to explain what each part does
- **Let user type the code** or ask for changes if needed

### **Teaching Style:**

- **Beginner-friendly explanations** - Assume no prior TypeScript knowledge
- **Real-world analogies** - Explain concepts using everyday examples
- **Visual explanations** - Use diagrams or examples when helpful
- **Repetition** - Reinforce concepts multiple times
- **Questions encouraged** - Always ask if user has questions

## 📋 **ASSIGNMENT REQUIREMENTS**

### **Core Requirements:**

1. **Visual Simulation:** Display real-time elevator positions, directions (↑/↓/idle), door states, and passenger counts
2. **Interactive Controls:** Adjust number of elevators (n), floors (k), request frequency, start/stop/reset, speed controls (1x, 2x, 5x)
3. **Request Handling:** Generate random requests with timestamp, origin floor, destination floor
4. **Peak Traffic Scenarios:** Simulate 70% requests from lobby at 9 AM morning rush hour
5. **Algorithm Design:** Minimize average wait time, prevent request starvation, balance elevator utilization

### **User Experience Biases (MUST IMPLEMENT):**

- **Priority Escalation:** Requests waiting > 30 seconds get higher priority
- **Morning Rush Optimization:** Prioritize lobby-to-upper-floor requests during 8-10 AM
- **Predictive Positioning:** Keep elevators near high-traffic floors during predictable peaks

### **Evaluation Criteria:**

1. **Simulation Quality:** Smooth animations, intuitive UI, real-time parameter adjustments
2. **Algorithm Performance:** Average/max wait time, average travel time, elevator utilization rate

## 🔧 **DETAILED BREAKDOWN - HOW IT WORKS**

### **🎯 SIMULATION FLOW:**

#### **1. Request Generation:**

- **Manual Requests:** User clicks ⬆️/⬇️ buttons → Creates request with timestamp, origin floor, destination floor
- **Auto Requests:** System generates random requests every second (assignment requirement)
- **Peak Traffic:** "Peak Traffic" button sets 30 floors, 6 elevators, 2 req/sec

#### **2. Request Processing:**

- **SCAN Algorithm:** Elevators move in one direction until no more requests, then reverse
- **Priority System:** Requests waiting > 30 seconds get higher priority
- **Assignment:** Scheduler finds best elevator for each request

#### **3. Elevator Movement:**

- **Smooth Animation:** Elevators move floor by floor with clean transitions
- **Passenger Management:** Passengers get on/off at each floor
- **Door States:** Doors open/close automatically

#### **4. Real-time Updates:**

- **WebSocket Communication:** Backend sends state updates every second
- **UI Updates:** Frontend displays current elevator positions, passenger counts, request status
- **Request Log:** Shows timestamp, origin floor, destination floor for all requests

### **🎯 KEY COMPONENTS:**

#### **Backend (Server):**

- **SimulationEngine:** Main simulation loop, manages time, generates requests
- **Scheduler:** SCAN algorithm, assigns requests to elevators
- **ElevatorClass:** Handles movement, passengers, door states
- **RequestClass:** Stores timestamp, origin, destination, priority

#### **Frontend (Client):**

- **App.tsx:** Main component, manages state, WebSocket connection
- **ElevatorDisplay:** Visual building with elevators and floor buttons
- **ControlPanel:** Start/stop/reset, speed, parameters
- **StatisticsPanel:** Performance metrics and analytics

### **🎯 ASSIGNMENT REQUIREMENTS MET:**

✅ **Timestamp Display:** Every request shows exact time in Request Log
✅ **Origin/Destination:** Shows "Floor X → Floor Y" for each request
✅ **Random Requests:** Auto-generates requests every second
✅ **Peak Traffic:** "Peak Traffic" button simulates rush hour
✅ **Speed Controls:** 1x (100%) to 10x (1000%) simulation rate
✅ **Real-time Visualization:** Live elevator movement and status
✅ **Interactive Controls:** Adjust floors, elevators, frequency

### **🎯 TEST SCENARIOS:**

#### **Scenario 1: Basic Test**

1. Click Reset → Set: 5 floors, 1 elevator
2. Click ⬆️ on Floor 3 → Creates manual request
3. Click Start → Auto-requests generate every second
4. Watch elevator move smoothly
5. Click Stop after 5 seconds

#### **Scenario 2: Peak Traffic**

1. Click "Peak Traffic" button → Sets 30 floors, 6 elevators, 2 req/sec
2. Click Start → High-frequency requests
3. Watch multiple elevators handle requests
4. Observe performance under stress

#### **Scenario 3: Speed Testing**

1. Set speed to 5x (500% simulation rate)
2. Start simulation
3. Watch fast elevator movement
4. Test different speeds (1x, 2x, 5x, 10x)

### **🎯 WHAT YOU'LL SEE:**

#### **Request Log:**

```
🔴 MANUAL Floor 3 → Floor 4 [10:30:15 AM]
🔵 AUTO Floor 1 → Floor 5 [10:30:16 AM]
🔵 AUTO Floor 2 → Floor 4 [10:30:17 AM]
```

#### **Elevator Status:**

- **Position:** Floor 3
- **Direction:** ⬆️ (going up)
- **Passengers:** 👥2/8 (2 passengers, 8 max capacity)
- **Target:** →4 (next destination)

#### **Statistics:**

- **Simulation Time:** 00:05 (5 seconds)
- **Total Requests:** 15
- **Completed:** 8
- **Average Wait Time:** 12.5s

### **🎯 SIMULATION RATE EXPLANATION:**

- **1x (100%):** Normal speed, 1 second = 1 simulation second
- **2x (200%):** Fast speed, 1 second = 2 simulation seconds
- **5x (500%):** Very fast, 1 second = 5 simulation seconds
- **10x (1000%):** Ultra fast, 1 second = 10 simulation seconds

This means at 5x speed, 5 seconds of simulation time pass in 1 real second.

### **🎯 WHAT THE USER CAN NOW SEE:**

#### **Priority System Working:**

```
🧪 Testing priority escalation
⏰ Long-waiting request: { fromFloor: 2, toFloor: 5 } (waiting 45s)
📋 Manual request: { fromFloor: 1, toFloor: 2 }
🎯 Elevator 1 targeting Floor 2 (pickup) for request Floor 2 → Floor 5 (Priority: 65.0)
🔄 Pickup completed for request Floor 2 → Floor 5
🎯 Elevator 1 targeting Floor 5 (delivery) for request Floor 2 → Floor 5 (Priority: 65.0)
🚀 Elevator 1 moved to floor 3
🚀 Elevator 1 moved to floor 4
🚀 Elevator 1 moved to floor 5
🎯 Elevator 1 reached target floor 5
🎉 MANUAL request completed: Floor 2 → Floor 5 by Elevator 1
```

#### **UI Request Log:**

```
🔴 MANUAL Floor 2 → Floor 5 🔥 HIGH 65.0 [6:24:02 PM]
🔵 AUTO Floor 1 → Floor 2 ⚡ 1.0 [6:24:03 PM]
✅ COMPLETED (MANUAL) Floor 2 → Floor 5 ✅ DONE [6:24:02 PM]  ← Shows completion!
```

#### **Test Scenario Results:**

1. **Click "Test Priority"** → Creates high-priority and normal requests
2. **Watch elevator** → Goes directly to high-priority request first
3. **See completion** → Request shows ✅ DONE with strikethrough
4. **Verify priority** → High-priority requests served before normal ones

### **🔍 TECHNICAL CONCEPTS EXPLAINED:**

#### **Priority Escalation System:**

**How it works:**

```typescript
// Priority calculation
priority = baseScore + (waitTime > 30 ? Math.pow(waitTime - 30, 1.5) : 0)

// Example: Request waiting 45 seconds
priority = 1 + Math.pow(45 - 30, 1.5) = 1 + 58.09 = 59.09
```

**Real-world analogy:**

- Normal requests = Regular customers at a restaurant
- High-priority requests = VIP customers who get served first
- Priority escalation = Customers who have been waiting get priority

#### **Two-Phase Request Completion:**

**Phase 1: Pickup**

```typescript
// Elevator goes to origin floor
elevator.setTarget(request.fromFloor); // Floor 2
// Passengers get on
request.isPickupComplete = true;
```

**Phase 2: Delivery**

```typescript
// Elevator goes to destination floor
elevator.setTarget(request.toFloor); // Floor 5
// Passengers get off
request.isDeliveryComplete = true;
```

**Real-world analogy:**

- Pickup = Taxi picking up passenger at their location
- Delivery = Taxi dropping off passenger at destination

#### **Interruption Prevention:**

**Problem:** New requests interrupt high-priority service
**Solution:** Check if elevator is serving high-priority request

```typescript
if (currentHighPriorityRequest) {
  // Skip new request assignment
  console.log("⏸️ Skipping request assignment - serving high-priority request");
} else {
  // Assign new request
}
```

**Real-world analogy:**

- Emergency vehicles get priority on roads
- Other vehicles must wait until emergency is resolved
