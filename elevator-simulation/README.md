# Elevator System Simulation & Optimization Assignment

## 🎯 **PROJECT OVERVIEW**

A web-based elevator simulation system with intelligent scheduling algorithm that efficiently handles passenger requests while prioritizing user experience.

## 📚 **LEARNING APPROACH - CRITICAL**

### **Step-by-Step Methodology:**

- **ONE file at a time** - Never generate multiple files simultaneously
- **ONE concept at a time** - Explain each TypeScript concept thoroughly before moving on
- **LINE-BY-LINE explanation** - Explain what each line of code does
- **SLOW pace** - User is learning TypeScript, so take it very slow
- **ASK for understanding** - Check if user understands before proceeding
- **NO overwhelming code** - Keep files small and simple

### **Code Generation Rules:**

- **Maximum 20-30 lines per file** initially
- **Explain every TypeScript concept** as it's introduced
- **Break complex concepts** into simple parts
- **Use comments extensively** to explain what each part does
- **Let user type the code** or ask for changes if needed

### **Teaching Style:**

- **Beginner-friendly explanations** - Assume no prior TypeScript knowledge
- **Real-world analogies** - Explain concepts using everyday examples
- **Visual explanations** - Use diagrams or examples when helpful
- **Repetition** - Reinforce concepts multiple times
- **Questions encouraged** - Always ask if user has questions

## 📋 **ASSIGNMENT REQUIREMENTS**

### **Core Requirements:**

1. **Visual Simulation:** Display real-time elevator positions, directions (↑/↓/idle), door states, and passenger counts
2. **Interactive Controls:** Adjust number of elevators (n), floors (k), request frequency, start/stop/reset, speed controls (1x, 2x, 5x)
3. **Request Handling:** Generate random requests with timestamp, origin floor, destination floor
4. **Peak Traffic Scenarios:** Simulate 70% requests from lobby at 9 AM morning rush hour
5. **Algorithm Design:** Minimize average wait time, prevent request starvation, balance elevator utilization

### **User Experience Biases (MUST IMPLEMENT):**

- **Priority Escalation:** Requests waiting > 30 seconds get higher priority
- **Morning Rush Optimization:** Prioritize lobby-to-upper-floor requests during 8-10 AM
- **Predictive Positioning:** Keep elevators near high-traffic floors during predictable peaks

### **Evaluation Criteria:**

1. **Simulation Quality:** Smooth animations, intuitive UI, real-time parameter adjustments
2. **Algorithm Performance:** Average/max wait time, average travel time, elevator utilization rate
3. **Stress Testing:** Handle 100+ simultaneous requests smoothly
4. **Code Quality:** Clean, modular, well-documented code

### **Deliverables:**

1. **Web Simulation:** Hosted locally or public demo link
2. **Source Code:** Include README with setup instructions
3. **Report (1-2 pages):** Algorithm design, user experience biases, performance metrics for 3 test scenarios

### **Bonus Points:**

- Compare two scheduling algorithms (SCAN vs custom approach)
- Add elevator capacity limits with visual warnings
- Pre-position idle elevators based on predicted demand

## 🔧 **DETAILED BREAKDOWN - HOW IT WORKS**

### **🎯 SIMULATION FLOW:**

#### **1. Request Generation:**

- **Manual Requests:** User clicks ⬆️/⬇️ buttons → Creates request with timestamp, origin floor, destination floor
- **Auto Requests:** System generates random requests every second (assignment requirement)
- **Peak Traffic:** "Peak Traffic" button sets 30 floors, 6 elevators, 2 req/sec

#### **2. Request Processing:**

- **SCAN Algorithm:** Elevators move in one direction until no more requests, then reverse
- **Priority System:** Requests waiting > 30 seconds get higher priority
- **Assignment:** Scheduler finds best elevator for each request

#### **3. Elevator Movement:**

- **Smooth Animation:** Elevators move floor by floor with clean transitions
- **Passenger Management:** Passengers get on/off at each floor
- **Door States:** Doors open/close automatically

#### **4. Real-time Updates:**

- **WebSocket Communication:** Backend sends state updates every second
- **UI Updates:** Frontend displays current elevator positions, passenger counts, request status
- **Request Log:** Shows timestamp, origin floor, destination floor for all requests

### **🎯 KEY COMPONENTS:**

#### **Backend (Server):**

- **SimulationEngine:** Main simulation loop, manages time, generates requests
- **Scheduler:** SCAN algorithm, assigns requests to elevators
- **ElevatorClass:** Handles movement, passengers, door states
- **RequestClass:** Stores timestamp, origin, destination, priority

#### **Frontend (Client):**

- **App.tsx:** Main component, manages state, WebSocket connection
- **ElevatorDisplay:** Visual building with elevators and floor buttons
- **ControlPanel:** Start/stop/reset, speed, parameters
- **StatisticsPanel:** Performance metrics and analytics

### **🎯 ASSIGNMENT REQUIREMENTS MET:**

✅ **Timestamp Display:** Every request shows exact time in Request Log
✅ **Origin/Destination:** Shows "Floor X → Floor Y" for each request
✅ **Random Requests:** Auto-generates requests every second
✅ **Peak Traffic:** "Peak Traffic" button simulates rush hour
✅ **Speed Controls:** 1x (100%) to 10x (1000%) simulation rate
✅ **Real-time Visualization:** Live elevator movement and status
✅ **Interactive Controls:** Adjust floors, elevators, frequency

### **🎯 TEST SCENARIOS:**

#### **Scenario 1: Basic Test**

1. Click Reset → Set: 5 floors, 1 elevator
2. Click ⬆️ on Floor 3 → Creates manual request
3. Click Start → Auto-requests generate every second
4. Watch elevator move smoothly
5. Click Stop after 5 seconds

#### **Scenario 2: Peak Traffic**

1. Click "Peak Traffic" button → Sets 30 floors, 6 elevators, 2 req/sec
2. Click Start → High-frequency requests
3. Watch multiple elevators handle requests
4. Observe performance under stress

#### **Scenario 3: Speed Testing**

1. Set speed to 5x (500% simulation rate)
2. Start simulation
3. Watch fast elevator movement
4. Test different speeds (1x, 2x, 5x, 10x)

### **🎯 WHAT YOU'LL SEE:**

#### **Request Log:**

```
🔴 MANUAL Floor 3 → Floor 4 [10:30:15 AM]
🔵 AUTO Floor 1 → Floor 5 [10:30:16 AM]
🔵 AUTO Floor 2 → Floor 4 [10:30:17 AM]
```

#### **Elevator Status:**

- **Position:** Floor 3
- **Direction:** ⬆️ (going up)
- **Passengers:** 👥2/8 (2 passengers, 8 max capacity)
- **Target:** →4 (next destination)

#### **Statistics:**

- **Simulation Time:** 00:05 (5 seconds)
- **Total Requests:** 15
- **Completed:** 8
- **Average Wait Time:** 12.5s

### **🎯 SIMULATION RATE EXPLANATION:**

- **1x (100%):** Normal speed, 1 second = 1 simulation second
- **2x (200%):** Fast speed, 1 second = 2 simulation seconds
- **5x (500%):** Very fast, 1 second = 5 simulation seconds
- **10x (1000%):** Ultra fast, 1 second = 10 simulation seconds

This means at 5x speed, 5 seconds of simulation time pass in 1 real second.

### **🎯 TECHNICAL CONCEPTS EXPLAINED:**

#### **🔌 WebSocket vs REST API - Why WebSocket?**

**REST API (Traditional):**

- Client asks server: "Give me elevator status"
- Server responds: "Elevator is on floor 3"
- Client asks again: "Give me elevator status"
- Server responds: "Elevator is on floor 4"
- **Problem:** Client must keep asking every second

**WebSocket (Real-time):**

- Client connects to server once
- Server automatically sends updates: "Elevator moved to floor 4"
- Server automatically sends updates: "New request created"
- **Benefit:** Real-time updates without constant asking

**Why WebSocket for Elevator Simulation?**

- Elevators move continuously
- Requests are generated every second
- UI needs to update in real-time
- REST API would be too slow and inefficient

#### **🔄 Simulation Flow - How It Works:**

**Step 1: Request Generation**

```typescript
// Manual Request (User clicks button)
User clicks ⬆️ on Floor 3
→ Creates: Floor 3 → Floor 4
→ Shows: 🔴 MANUAL Floor 3 → Floor 4 [timestamp]

// Auto Request (System generates)
Every 1 second, system creates random request
→ Creates: Floor 1 → Floor 5 (random)
→ Shows: 🔵 AUTO Floor 1 → Floor 5 [timestamp]
```

**Step 2: Request Assignment**

```typescript
// Scheduler finds best elevator
Request: Floor 3 → Floor 4
Available elevators: [Elevator 1, Elevator 2]
→ Assigns to: Elevator 1 (closest)
→ Sets elevator target: Floor 3
```

**Step 3: Elevator Movement**

```typescript
// Elevator moves floor by floor
Elevator 1: Floor 1 → Floor 2 → Floor 3
→ Picks up passengers at Floor 3
→ Moves to: Floor 4
→ Drops off passengers
```

**Step 4: Request Completion**

```typescript
// Request is completed
Request: Floor 3 → Floor 4
→ Changes to: ✅ COMPLETED Floor 3 → Floor 4 [timestamp]
→ Removed from pending requests
→ Statistics updated
```

#### **🎯 Key Files We Modified Today:**

**1. `src/server/services/SimulationEngine.ts`**

- Added `completeRequestsForElevator()` method
- Tracks when requests are successfully served
- Updates statistics in real-time

**2. `src/client/src/App.tsx`**

- Added request completion tracking
- Shows completed requests with green checkmark
- Real-time status updates

**3. `src/client/src/components/ControlPanel.tsx`**

- Added "Peak Traffic" button
- Shows simulation rate as percentage
- Better user controls

**4. `src/client/src/components/ElevatorDisplay.css`**

- Fixed text overflow issues
- Clean elevator movement animations
- Professional layout

### **🎯 What You Can Now See:**

#### **Request Log Example:**

```
🔴 MANUAL Floor 3 → Floor 4 [10:30:15 AM]
🔵 AUTO Floor 1 → Floor 5 [10:30:16 AM]
✅ COMPLETED (MANUAL) Floor 3 → Floor 4 [10:30:15 AM]  ← Shows completion!
🔵 AUTO Floor 2 → Floor 4 [10:30:17 AM]
✅ COMPLETED (AUTO) Floor 1 → Floor 5 [10:30:16 AM]  ← Shows completion!
```

**Note:** The UI now properly shows when your manual requests are completed. The system prioritizes completing manual requests first, then auto requests.

#### **Test Scenario:**

1. **Click Reset** → Set: 5 floors, 1 elevator
2. **Click ⬆️ on Floor 3** → See: 🔴 MANUAL Floor 3 → Floor 4
3. **Click Start** → See: 🔵 AUTO requests appearing
4. **Watch elevator move** → Floor 1 → Floor 2 → Floor 3 → Floor 4
5. **See completion** → Request changes to ✅ COMPLETED with strikethrough

## 🧠 **ALGORITHM DESIGN STRATEGY**

### **Base Algorithm: Enhanced SCAN**

- **SCAN (Elevator):** Elevators move in one direction until no more requests, then reverse
- **Priority Enhancement:** Requests get higher priority after 30 seconds
- **Traffic Pattern Recognition:** Detects morning rush (9 AM) and prioritizes lobby→upper floor requests
- **Load Balancing:** Distributes requests across elevators to prevent overcrowding
- **Predictive Positioning:** Keeps elevators near high-traffic floors during predictable peaks

### **Key Features to Implement:**

1. **Priority Escalation:** `priority = baseScore + (waitTime > 30 ? (waitTime - 30) ^ 1.5 : 0)`
2. **Morning Rush Detection:** `isMorningRush = (hour >= 8 && hour <= 10)`
3. **Lobby Priority:** `if (isMorningRush && request.originFloor === 1) priority += 3`
4. **Anti-Starvation:** Maximum wait time cap of 120 seconds
5. **Load Balancing:** Dynamic elevator utilization monitoring

## 📊 **PERFORMANCE TARGETS**

### **🔍 TECHNICAL CONCEPTS EXPLAINED:**

#### **WebSocket vs REST API:**

**REST API (Traditional):**

- Client asks server: "Give me elevator status"
- Server responds: "Elevator is on floor 3"
- Client asks again: "Give me elevator status"
- Server responds: "Elevator is on floor 4"
- **Problem:** Client must keep asking every second

**WebSocket (Real-time):**

- Client connects to server once
- Server automatically sends updates: "Elevator moved to floor 4"
- Server automatically sends updates: "New request created"
- **Benefit:** Real-time updates without constant asking

**Why WebSocket for Elevator Simulation?**

- Elevators move continuously
- Requests are generated every second
- UI needs to update in real-time
- REST API would be too slow and inefficient

#### **Simulation Flow:**

**Step 1: Request Generation**

```typescript
// Manual Request (User clicks button)
User clicks ⬆️ on Floor 3
→ Creates: Floor 3 → Floor 4
→ Shows: 🔴 MANUAL Floor 3 → Floor 4 [timestamp]

// Auto Request (System generates)
Every 1 second, system creates random request
→ Creates: Floor 1 → Floor 5 (random)
→ Shows: 🔵 AUTO Floor 1 → Floor 5 [timestamp]
```

**Step 2: Request Assignment**

```typescript
// Scheduler finds best elevator
Request: Floor 3 → Floor 4
Available elevators: [Elevator 1, Elevator 2]
→ Assigns to: Elevator 1 (closest)
→ Sets elevator target: Floor 3
```

**Step 3: Elevator Movement**

```typescript
// Elevator moves floor by floor
Elevator 1: Floor 1 → Floor 2 → Floor 3
→ Picks up passengers at Floor 3
→ Moves to: Floor 4
→ Drops off passengers
```

**Step 4: Request Completion**

```typescript
// Request is completed
Request: Floor 3 → Floor 4
→ Changes to: ✅ COMPLETED Floor 3 → Floor 4 [timestamp]
→ Removed from pending requests
→ Statistics updated
```
