4. Verify elevator moves smoothly between floors
5. Check that requests are displayed in the log

**Expected Results**:

- ✅ Elevator moves smoothly at 18 floors/second
- ✅ Requests appear in real-time log
- ✅ Statistics update every second
- ✅ No errors in browser console

### 2. **Algorithm Performance Test**

5. Verify it achieves 60%+ completion

**Expected Results**:

- ✅ Completion rate: 60%+ (target: 63.3%)
- ✅ Average wait time: <2 seconds
- ✅ Elevator utilization: >90%
- ✅ No request starvation

### 3. **Peak Traffic Stress Test**

## 🔧 Algorithm Implementation

### Hybrid Aggressive Scheduler

Our algorithm uses a **multi-factor scoring system**:

```typescript
private calculateScore(elevator: Elevator, request: Request): number {
  const distanceScore = this.calculateDistanceScore(elevator, request) * 0.35;
  const loadScore = this.calculateLoadScore(elevator) * 0.2;
  const routeScore = this.calculateRouteScore(elevator, request) * 0.25;
  const directionScore = this.calculateDirectionScore(elevator, request) * 0.15;
  const priorityScore = this.calculatePriorityScore(request) * 0.03;

  return distanceScore + loadScore + routeScore + directionScore + priorityScore;
}
```

### Key Algorithm Components

1. **Distance Scoring (35%)**: Proximity with load adjustment
2. **Load Distribution (20%)**: Prevents overloading
3. **Route Efficiency (25%)**: Optimizes travel paths
4. **Direction Matching (15%)**: Natural user expectations
5. **Priority Escalation (3%)**: Prevents request starvation

## 🎮 User Experience Features

### Priority Escalation

- **Fast Escalation**: Starts after 3 seconds
- **Emergency Boost**: 400 points after 10 seconds
- **Super Emergency**: 1000 points after 20 seconds

### Morning Rush Optimization

- **Time-based Priority**: 8-10 AM rush hour
- **Lobby-to-Upper Bonus**: 150 points for lobby requests
- **Predictive Positioning**: Keeps elevators near high-traffic areas

### Load Balancing

- **Prevents Overloading**: Distance scoring adjusted by current load
- **Even Distribution**: Balanced passenger distribution across elevators
- **Dynamic Rebalancing**: Responds to changing conditions

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **WebSocket Connection Failed**

   - Check if backend server is running on port 8080
   - Verify firewall settings
   - Check browser console for connection errors

2. **Simulation Runs Slowly**

   - Reduce simulation speed to 1x
   - Check browser performance (close other tabs)
   - Verify system has sufficient RAM

3. **Build Errors**
   - Run `npm install` in both root and client directories
   - Check Node.js version (requires 16+)
   - Clear npm cache: `npm cache clean --force`
