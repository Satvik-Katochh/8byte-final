# Elevator System Simulation & Optimization - Algorithm Report

## Executive Summary

This report presents an analysis of our **Hybrid Aggressive** elevator scheduling algorithm implementation. Our algorithm combines multiple optimization strategies to balance efficiency with user experience. The system successfully measures and displays real-time performance metrics including completion rates, wait times, and travel times.

## 🎯 What We Built & Why It Matters

### The Problem We Solved

Traditional elevator systems suffer from:

- **Low completion rates** during peak times
- **Long wait times** for passengers
- **Poor user experience** with request starvation
- **Inefficient resource utilization** (some elevators overloaded, others idle)

### Our Solution

We created a **Hybrid Aggressive Scheduler** that:

- ✅ **Implements multi-factor scoring** for elevator selection
- ✅ **Prevents request starvation** through priority escalation
- ✅ **Balances elevator load** to prevent overcrowding
- ✅ **Prioritizes user experience** with time-based biases
- ✅ **Uses hybrid strategy** combining distance, load, and efficiency
- ✅ **Measures real-time performance** with completion rates and timing metrics

## 🔬 Algorithm Design Deep Dive

### Core Philosophy: "Complete More, Optimize Later"

Our algorithm prioritizes **completion rate** over **perfect efficiency** because:

- **User satisfaction** depends more on getting picked up than perfect routes
- **Real-world scenarios** require handling unpredictable request patterns
- **Peak traffic** needs aggressive response, not perfect optimization

### The Multi-Factor Scoring System

We use a **weighted scoring approach** that considers 5 key factors:

#### 1. **Hybrid Distance Scoring (35% weight)**

```
Formula: distanceScore = max(0, 100 - distance * 0.6) * (1 - totalLoad * 0.1)
```

**What it does:**

- Closer elevators get higher scores
- Current passenger load reduces the score
- Prevents overloading while maintaining proximity preference

**Implementation Status:** ✅ **Fully implemented** in `calculateHybridAggressiveScore()`

#### 2. **Balanced Load Distribution (20% weight)**

```
Formula: loadScore = max(0, 100 - totalLoad * 25)
```

**What it does:**

- Empty elevators get perfect score (100)
- Each passenger reduces score by 25 points
- Ensures even distribution across all elevators

**Implementation Status:** ✅ **Fully implemented** in `calculateHybridAggressiveScore()`

#### 3. **Enhanced Route Efficiency (25% weight)**

```
Perfect Fit: 1.0 (both floors in current path)
Good Fit: 0.95 (one floor in path)
Route Penalty: Reduced by 3.5x for completion focus
```

**What it does:**

- Rewards elevators already going in the right direction
- Gives bonus for perfect route matches
- Applies reduced penalties to prioritize completion

**Implementation Status:** ✅ **Fully implemented** in `calculateRouteEfficiency()`

#### 4. **Direction Matching (15% weight)**

```
Perfect Match: 1.0 (same direction)
Idle Elevator: 0.8 (increased from 0.6)
Poor Match: 0.5 (increased from 0.3)
```

**What it does:**

- Prefers elevators going in the same direction
- Gives idle elevators decent score (not perfect)
- Accepts opposite direction if necessary

**Implementation Status:** ✅ **Fully implemented** in `calculateDirectionMatch()`

#### 5. **Priority Escalation (3% weight)**

```
Fast Escalation: Starts after 3 seconds
Emergency Boost: 400 points after 10 seconds
Super Emergency: 1000 points after 20 seconds
```

**What it does:**

- Gives waiting requests higher priority over time
- Prevents any request from being ignored forever
- Creates urgency for long-waiting passengers

**Implementation Status:** ✅ **Fully implemented** in `calculateUserExperienceBonus()`

### Key Design Decisions & Their Impact

#### 1. **Ultra-Aggressive Thresholds**

```
Rebalancing threshold: 3 requests (reduced from 5)
Sorting threshold: 3 requests (reduced from 5)
```

**Why we did this:**

- Faster response to changing conditions
- Better handling of peak traffic
- More dynamic elevator allocation

**Implementation Status:** ✅ **Implemented** in `emergencyRebalancing()` and `sortRequestsByPriority()`

#### 2. **Fast Movement Speed**

```
Movement speed: 18 floors per second
```

**Why we did this:**

- Maximum responsiveness to requests
- Better handling of high-frequency scenarios
- Realistic for modern elevator systems

**Implementation Status:** ✅ **Implemented** in elevator movement logic

#### 3. **Predictive Positioning**

```
Positioning threshold: 2 floors
```

**Why we did this:**

- Keeps elevators near high-traffic areas
- Reduces wait times for common requests
- Proactive rather than reactive approach

**Implementation Status:** ✅ **Implemented** in `predictivePositioning()`

## 🚀 User Experience Biases Implementation

### 1. **Priority Escalation for Long-Waiting Requests**

**What we implemented:**

- Requests waiting > 30 seconds get 400-point bonus
- Requests waiting > 20 seconds get 200-point bonus
- Requests waiting > 10 seconds get 100-point bonus

**How it works:**

```typescript
if (waitTime > 30) bonus += 400;
else if (waitTime > 20) bonus += 200;
else if (waitTime > 10) bonus += 100;
```

**Implementation Status:** ✅ **Fully implemented** in `calculateUserExperienceBonus()`

### 2. **Morning Rush Hour Optimization**

**What we implemented:**

- Prioritizes lobby-to-upper-floor requests during 8-10 AM
- 150-point bonus for rush hour requests
- Time-based priority adjustment

**How it works:**

```typescript
const isRushHour = currentHour >= 8 && currentHour <= 10;
const isLobbyToUpper = origin === 1 && destination > 1;
if (isRushHour && isLobbyToUpper) score += 150;
```

**Implementation Status:** ✅ **Fully implemented** in `calculateUserExperienceBonus()`

### 3. **Predictive Positioning**

**What we implemented:**

- Keeps elevators near high-traffic floors
- 2-floor threshold for aggressive positioning
- Proactive elevator movement

**How it works:**

```typescript
const highTrafficFloors = [1, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15];
if (distanceToHighTraffic <= 2) score += 80;
```

**Implementation Status:** ✅ **Fully implemented** in `predictivePositioning()`

### 4. **Additional User Experience Features**

**Direction Bonus:**

- +50 points for upward requests
- +30 points for downward requests
- Natural user expectation

**High-Traffic Bonus:**

- +80 points for high-traffic floors
- Lobby and floors 10-15 get priority
- Based on real-world usage patterns

**Load Adjustment:**

- Distance scoring adjusted based on current load
- Prevents overloading while maintaining proximity preference
