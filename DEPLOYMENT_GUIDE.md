# 🚀 Railway Deployment Guide

## ✅ **What I've Fixed For You:**

1. **Created `.env` file** with environment variables
2. **Fixed hardcoded URLs** in WebSocket connection
3. **Updated CORS settings** for Railway
4. **Added Railway configuration** file
5. **Updated build scripts** for production
6. **Fixed Railway build process** - now uses correct build command
7. **Tested build process** - everything works!

## 🚀 **Deploy to Railway (3 Simple Steps):**

### **Step 1: Create Railway Account**

1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Click "Start a New Project"
3. Sign up with GitHub (recommended)

### **Step 2: Connect Your Repository**

1. In Railway, click "New Project"
2. Choose "Deploy from GitHub repo"
3. Select your `elevator-simulation` repository
4. Railway will automatically detect it's a Node.js app

### **Step 3: Deploy!**

- Railway reads your `package.json`
- Runs `npm run build` automatically
- Starts your server with `npm start`
- Your app is live! 🎉

## 🔧 **What Railway Does Automatically:**

- **Builds your app**: `npm run build`
- **Starts server**: `npm start`
- **Handles ports**: No more hardcoded localhost:8080
- **Provides HTTPS**: Secure connections
- **Auto-deploys**: Every push to main branch

## 🌐 **Your App Will Be Available At:**

- **Railway URL**: `https://your-app-name.railway.app`
- **WebSocket**: Same URL (automatic)
- **Frontend + Backend**: Both served together

## 📝 **Environment Variables (Railway Sets These):**

- `PORT`: Railway assigns automatically
- `RAILWAY_ENVIRONMENT`: Set to 'production'
- `RAILWAY_PUBLIC_DOMAIN`: Your app's public URL

## 🧪 **Test Locally First:**

```bash
# Test that everything works:
npm run dev

# Or test production build:
npm run build
npm start
```

## 🚨 **If Something Goes Wrong:**

1. **Check Railway logs** in the dashboard
2. **Verify build success** in Railway
3. **Check environment variables** are set
4. **Restart deployment** if needed

## 🎯 **Success Indicators:**

- ✅ Build completes without errors
- ✅ Server starts successfully
- ✅ WebSocket connection works
- ✅ Frontend loads properly
- ✅ Elevator simulation runs

## 🚀 **Ready to Deploy?**

Your code is now **100% ready for Railway**! Just follow the 3 steps above and your elevator simulation will be live on the internet! 🎉
